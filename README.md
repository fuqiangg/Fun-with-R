# Sherry's website
An R Markdown website adapted from template  [https://fuqiangg.github.io/Fun-with-R/](https://fuqiangg.github.io/Fun-with-R/)

To use this, click the download as .zip button to start from a local computer, or skip down to the github example to fork this and get started that way.

The unzipped folder contains all of the files you need to compile a website in R Markdown. This should all work fine if you have the latest version of R and R-studio installed.
